# Serde JSON &emsp; [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/serde-rs/json.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/serde-rs/json) [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/serde_json.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/serde\_json)

**Serde is a framework for *ser*ializing and *de*serializing Rust data structures efficiently and generically.**

## Serde JSON in action

```toml
[dependencies]
serde_json = "0.8"
```

Out of the box, Serde JSON is able to serialize and deserialize most Rust
standard library types as JSON (primitives, `String`, `HashMap`, tuples, `Vec`,
`Option`, etc). This works equally well on stable and nightly compilers and does
not require code generation or a build script.

Serde JSON can also serialize and deserialize structs and enums defined in your
program. See Serde's [codegen documentation](https://serde.rs/codegen.html) for
how to set this up.

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;

extern crate serde_json;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    // Convert the Point to a JSON string.
    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&point).unwrap();

    // Prints serialized = {"x":1,"y":2}
    println!("serialized = {}", serialized);

    // Convert the JSON string back to a Point.
    let deserialized: Point = serde_json::from_str(&serialized).unwrap();

    // Prints deserialized = Point { x: 1, y: 2 }
    println!("deserialized = {:?}", deserialized);
}
```

## Getting help

Serde developers live in the #serde channel on
[`irc.mozilla.org`](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC). The #rust channel is also a
good resource with generally faster response time but less specific knowledge
about Serde. If IRC is not your thing, we are happy to respond to [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/serde-rs/json/issues/new) as well.
